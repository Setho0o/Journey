# Journey

The purpose of this project is to learn various generation algorithms, and possibly some path finding algorithms such as _a*_ 

## Goals
Cache previous pathfinding calculations to avoid redundant queries

###### Algorithms
Wave function collapse\
A*\
Poisson disk sampling

###### Maps / generation
Dungeon\
Forest / land area
	 
## Tasks
add tile scaling support must be 16x16\
get more asset images\
start on wfc\
add ids to cells and draw the corresponding assest\
