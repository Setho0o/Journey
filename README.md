# Journey

The purpose of this project is to learn various generation algorithms, and possibly some path finding algorithms such as _a*_ 

## Goals
Cache previous pathfinding calculations to avoid redundant queries

###### Algorithms
Wave function collapse\
A*\
Poisson disk sampling

###### Maps / generation
Dungeon\
Forest / land area
